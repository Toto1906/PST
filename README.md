# Dynamics and Modeling of a Water Rocket

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to design and model a water rocket from 1.5 L PET soda bottles. To realize this, we first need to get an estimate of how far our rocket will go with a mathematical model and to be able to compare it to the result we have. Our model will be an approximation of the actual scenario. The goal is to compare it to an actual rocket we will also design, and characterize how our initial assumptions and simplifications impact the accuracy of the model.
